2.Remotely Connecting
<pre>
If on Windows, install a program by the name of OpenSSH, no programs need to be installed on Mac. Then, open the terminal in VS code by clicking on Terminal -> new terminal in the menu button. Type in the command prompt:  ssh cs15lwi22ant@ieng6.ucsd.edu 
3. 4.Trying Some Commands
	There are many commands to use in the terminal. Some examples are pwd, which means print working directory, cd, which means current directory, ls -a meaning show files, and scp meaning secure files. Here are some outputs of some commands.
4.Moving Files with scp
To move files with SCP, use the command: scp WhereAmI.java cs15lwi22ant@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/. After entering in your password, it should look something like this:
 
5.Setting an SSH Key
In order to bypass entering the computerâ€™s password everytime when using scp, SSH-keygen is a great way to get past this. The command for setting up an SSH key is 	ssh-keygen. After that is set up, logout of session, and run client locally with command should look something like this:						
6.Optimizing Remote Running
	To run commands remotely, use the command ssh cs15lwi22@ieng6.ucsd.edu "ls". It is also useful to use a semicolon so that multiple files can be run at once, such as cp WhereAmI.java OtherMain.java; javac OtherMain.java; java WhereAmI
