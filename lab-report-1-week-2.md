## Lab report week 1
# 1.Installing VScode

To install VScode, first go to the VS code website,  https://code.visualstudio.com,  and download the version on either Mac or Windows. Once that finishes, load up the file, and it should look something like this.

# 2.Remotely Connecting

If on Windows, install a program by the name of OpenSSH, no programs need to be installed on Mac. Then, open the terminal in VS code by clicking on Terminal -> new terminal in the menu button. Type in the command prompt:  ssh cs15lwi22ant@ieng6.ucsd.edu

# 3.Trying Some Commands

There are many commands to use in the terminal. Some examples are pwd, which means print working directory, cd, which means current directory, ls -a meaning show files, and scp meaning secure files. Here are some outputs of some commands.

# 4.Moving Files with scp

To move files with SCP, use the command: scp WhereAmI.java cs15lwi22ant@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/. After entering in your password, it should look something like this:

# 5.Setting an SSH Key

In order to bypass entering the computerâ€™s password everytime when using scp, SSH-keygen is a great way to get past this. The command for setting up an SSH key is 	ssh-keygen. After that is set up, logout of session, and run client locally with command should look something like this:

![ssh3](ssh-key3.png)

My passphrase is not empty, which is why it prompts for passphrase in future steps.

# 6.Optimizing Remote Running

To run commands remotely, use the command ssh cs15lwi22@ieng6.ucsd.edu "ls". It is also useful to use a semicolon so that multiple files can be run at once, such as cp WhereAmI.java OtherMain.java; javac OtherMain.java; java WhereAmI
